## About

Fork from [MkDocs Embed External Markdown Plugin](https://github.com/fire1ce/mkdocs-embed-external-markdown) and fix the conflict with mkdocs-macros plugin and support access of Gitea private repo by token. The basic functionality is the same as the original plugin. But when rendering markdown, it search the opening tag (@include) in the whole text and replace it with the content of the included file.

## Installation

Install the package with pip:

```shell
pip install mkdocs-embed-markdown
```

## Configuration

Enable the plugin in your `mkdocs.yml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  - external-markdown
```

## Compatibility with Github/Gitea Private Repository

If the GH_TOKEN environment variable is set with an authorized personal access token then the authorization header will be added to the request and content from private repositories can be fetched.

For Gitea users, the GT_TOKEN environment variable can be used instead. You may need to go to profile > settings > applications > Manage Access Tokens, and add your token to the environment variable. The key is GT_TOKEN, and the value is your token.

## Usage

- Section defined by **"##/###/####..."** header (h2/h3/h4...)
- **"#"** header (h1) will be **removed** from source content so you can use use your own header
- **"##/###/####..."** header (h2/h3/h4...) will be **removed** from source **section** content so you can use use your own header
- Supports multiple **sections** from any source

`@include` requires 2 parameters: **url** and **section name**.

```makrdown
@include('url', '## section name')
```
